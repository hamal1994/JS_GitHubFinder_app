* Notes for developer:

-Register a new OAuth Application: Register it on GitHub otherwise you will only get 50 requests and then it will stop working. \
OAuth is a standard that apps can use to provide client applications with secure delegated access OAuth works over HTTP and authorizes Devices, APIs, Servers and Applications with access tokens rather than credentials.
- When we type in the search bar we want an ajax request to the GitHub api
- We want to make a request to the githubs api profile url

Scripts used:
